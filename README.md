# DSA Python- this repo contains all the basic classes like Linked List, Tree, Doubly Linked List, Hash Tables and also their method necessary to understand them.
I also prepared the function for sorting algorithms(Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick etc) and searching algorithms(Depth Per Search and Breadth Per Search)
If anyone have a little bit idea about Data Structures and Algorithms this will really helpful them as a revision and if not then please do check youtube videos and took a idea about Big(O) concepts and then what is space and time complexity.
for newcomer you can  watch these playlists might be useful for you.
